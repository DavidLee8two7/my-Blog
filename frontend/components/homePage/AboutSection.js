            A few years ago, I discovered my passion for web development, and I
            decided to begin my transition into this new and exciting field.
            After leaving my job of 5 years as a good performing ERP system
            manager / Business Data analyst. The change in direction was
            challenging, however, I knew that my drive to be in this field would
            only grow because it combines being able to tap into my creative
            side while also utilizing my love for problem-solving.
          </p>
          <p>
            I now only focus on being a web developer but my knowledge of
            multiple fields allows me to work on a project with the full scope
            in mind; simplifying the process of our working together and
            producing a more cohesive experience for your users.
