            As a web developer, I enjoy using my obsessive attention to detail,
            my unequivocal love for making things, and my mission-driven work
            ethic to build better future for our children and seniors. I‚Äôve
            always sought out opportunities and challenges that are meaningful
            to me. Although my professional path has taken many twists and turns
            - from ERP(SAP) system developing, Supply chain management, Business
            analyze & consulting - I've never stopped engaging my passion to
            help others and solve problems.
